							<p class="heading3">Masters Degree - Elementary Education | Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College</p>
							He has taught English as a second language for three years in a low-income school and is a Teach For America alumnus. guest speakers played a crucial role in his educational development. As a result, he also became a first generation college graduate. Despite the challenge of finding guest speakers, Richie persevered to bring guests from diverse backgrounds and careers to invest his students in their short- and long-term goals. He saw the positive effects these experiences had on motivating students, which led to greater academic achievement. This experience impassioned him to create a system that would facilitate connections between students and guest speakers in the classroom.

							<p class="heading3">Ph.D. Candidate - Management | W.P. Carey School of Business</p>
							This venture personally moves Chris because he has seen the importance of guest speakers in his own formative educational experience, which led him to be the first in his family to graduate from college. Chris has a passion for teaching and empowering learners in the classroom and has previously worked as a consultant creating English language training curricula with the mission of providing leadership opportunities to employees. These experiences opened his eyes to the link between educational opportunities and professional advancement in a concrete way as he saw employees attain levels of success they never previously thought possible. As a Ph.D. student, Chris has studied the positive effects that volunteerism has on employees in the workplace and seen the transformative change that education can have. Chris will use his management knowledge and relationships to develop and grow HEROES.
